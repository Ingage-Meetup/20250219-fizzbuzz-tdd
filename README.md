# FizzBuzz - TDD
Fizz Buzz is a simple game used to teach elementary school kids division, but it is also often used as a computer programming exercise.

## The Rules (Requirements)
* Only positive numbers are allowed, so if the number is negative, the program should not say anything
* If a number is not evenly divisible by 3 or 5, the program should not say anything
* If a number is evenly divisible by 3, the program should say "Fizz"
* If a number is evenly divisible by 5, the program should say "Buzz"
* If a number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, the program should say "Fizz Buzz"

## Goals
* Look for ways to build code iteratively
  * You might be tempted to solve the whole thing and then write unit tests – don’t! 
* Get more comfortable with TDD and Unit Testing!
  * This is a relatively simple problem, but we want to learn more about unit testing, building on last month’s exercise
  * You should have at least one unit test for each requirement
* Try not to use the debugger or things like console.log/println statements
  * This is a simple enough problem that if you build it iteratively and have good unit tests, you should not need to do any debugging

## Recommended Unit Tests
You should implement at least the following unit tests – but you may add others as you see fit.
* Any negative number returns empty string
* 13 returns empty string (sanity check – it has the number 3, but is not evenly divisible by 3 or 5)
* 3 returns "Fizz"
* 21 returns "Fizz"
* 5 returns "Buzz"
* 40 returns "Buzz"
* 15 returns "Fizz Buzz"
